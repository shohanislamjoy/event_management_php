   ```

2. **Create the users table:**
   ```sql
   USE event_management_php;
   
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,

   VALUES ('Admin', 'admin@gmail.com', '1234567890', '$2y$10$example_hashed_password');
   ```
   *Note: Use the signup form to create the admin account with email `admin@gmail.com`*

### 3. Configuration

1. **Update database connection settings** in `connection.php`:
   ```php
   $host = "localhost";

   chmod 644 *.php
   ```

### 4. Web Server Setup
