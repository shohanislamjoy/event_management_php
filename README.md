### Step 2: Configure Web Server

#### Apache Configuration

1. Copy files to your web server directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r * /var/www/html/event_management/
   ```

2. Ensure proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/event_management/
   ```

#### Local Development (XAMPP/WAMP)

1. Copy the project folder to your htdocs directory
2. Start Apache and MySQL services
3. Access via `http://localhost/event_management_php/`

### Step 3: Database Configuration

Update the database connection settings in `connection.php`:

```php
$host = "localhost";        // Your MySQL host
$username = "root";         // Your MySQL username
$password = "";             // Your MySQL password
$database = 'event_management_php';  // Database name
```

## üóÑ Database Setup

### Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE event_management_php;
USE event_management_php;
```

### Create Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Create Admin User

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, phone, password) VALUES 
('Administrator', 'admin@gmail.com', '1234567890', '$2y$10$example_hashed_password');
